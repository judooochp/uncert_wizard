?,Primary Rules for *.ucrt files:
?,Prefix symbols:#opening;!summary;?comment
?,Summary Line must be second line:
?,Summary Prefix (first member): "!"
?,Summary Value (second member): Resolution of measurement must be reflected
?,Summary Resolution (third member): float representation of resolution
?,this is not a true resolution for uncertainty, so it's just a 0.0...01 type value.
?,Summary Unit (fourth member): include SI prefix if true to measurement;
?,for instance "kΩ" or "mm" or "µin"
?,Summary Uncertainty (fifth member, optional):
?,Must be greater than or equal to 1 if included
?,If included must be followed by at least one comma to denote
?,the same unit as the measurement; then followed by the unit's
?,SI prefix for the uncertainty.
?,Summary Uncertainty Unit (sixth member, optional):
?,Lines with no prefix are uncertainty components
?,Only decimal resolution is currently supported
?,Uncertainty components (first member) have no prefix
?,Type A uncertainty members are strung together
?,each entry preceded by "~" and followed by the terminating comma
?,For example "~1.2~1.2~1.3~1.1~1.2"
?,Type B uncertainty components have no prefix
?,Source values (second member):
?,m  = Method       incomplete information; technician training; etc
?,s  = Standard     cal cert uncert; drift spec; coeff therm exp; etc
?,u  = UUT          resolution; repeatability; etc
?,e  = Environment  temperature effects; condensing %RH; etc
?,Distribution values (third member):
?,n1 = Normal       k=1
?,n2 = Normal       k=2
?,n3 = Normal       k=3
?,u  = UShaped      k=sqrt(2)
?,r  = Rectangular  k=sqrt(3)
?,q  = Quadratic    k=sqrt(5)
?,t  = Triangular   k=sqrt(6)
?,Sensitivity Coefficient (fourth member): Integer value
?,Description (fifth member): Character string; Human readable
?,should be unique per file
?,Reference (sixth member, optional): Character string; Human readable
?,maybe a national standard or document; perhaps a certificate number
?,Reference URL (seventh member, optional): Character string;
?,file location such as URL to HTML or PDF document;
?,reference URL requires Reference member
?,NO OTHER MEMBERS SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME
?,Last line in file is the date/time code:
?,YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmm:
?,4-digit year;2-digit month;2-digit day;2-digit hour in 24-hour format;
?,2-digit minute;2-digit second;3-digit millisecond
