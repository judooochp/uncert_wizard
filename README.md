Uncertainty calculation library in Rust

In my first something to learn Rust, I have attempted to calculate and display uncertainties. There are still some issues, such as the floating point error that you'll see complained about in the comments.
The choices made are not optimal, as I still have struggles with borrowing, etc. My main method was to get the compiler to shut its mouth rather than to fix it in the best way possible.
Good luck. It ain't much, but it's mine.
